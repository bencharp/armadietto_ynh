## Armadietto overview

[Armadietto](https://github.com/remotestorage/armadietto) is a [remoteStorage](https://remotestorage.io) server written for Node.js.
It is a complete rewrite of [reStore](https://github.com/jcoglan/restore).

Armadietto is maintained by remoteStorage Team [IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/#remotestorage)

> ### :warning: WARNING
> Please do not consider `armadietto` production ready, this project is still
> considered experimental.  As with any alpha-stage storage technology, you
> MUST expect that it will eat your data and take precautions against this. You
> SHOULD expect that its APIs and storage schemas will change before it is
> labelled stable.

**Shipped version:** 0.1.5


### Important Notes
RemoteStorage requires a dedicated domain, so obtain one and add it using the YunoHost admin panel. **Domains -> Add domain**. As RemoteStorage uses the full domain and is installed on the root, you can create a subdomain such as remote.domain.tld. Don't forget to update your DNS if you manage them manually.

RemoteStorage requires browser-approved SSL certificates. If you have certificates not issued by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), install them manually as usual.
